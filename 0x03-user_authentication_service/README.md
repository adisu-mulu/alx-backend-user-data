# User Authentication Service

This directory contains the code and resources related to the User Authentication Service. The User Authentication Service is responsible for handling user authentication and providing secure access to protected resources.

## Program Listings

- [app.py](https://github.com/iakev/alx-backend-user-data/blob/main/0x03-user_authentication_service/app.py): This Python script contains the main application setup and configuration. It defines the Flask application and sets up routes for the authentication API.

- [auth.py](https://github.com/iakev/alx-backend-user-data/blob/main/0x03-user_authentication_service/auth.py): The `auth.py` script includes authentication-related functions and middleware for protecting routes that require authentication.

- [db.py](https://github.com/iakev/alx-backend-user-data/blob/main/0x03-user_authentication_service/db.py): This script provides database functionality and interaction with user data. It defines the data models and schemas used for user profiles and authentication tokens.

- [user.py](https://github.com/iakev/alx-backend-user-data/blob/main/0x03-user_authentication_service/user.py): The `user.py` script contains user-related functionality, such as user registration and user data management.

## Compiling and Executing

To compile and execute the User Authentication Service, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies listed in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/iakev/alx-backend-user-data/blob/main/0x03-user_authentication_service/requirements.txt) using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. Navigate to the root directory and run the Flask application by executing `python app.py`. This will start the User Authentication Service.

3. Access the API endpoints defined in `app.py` to perform user registration, login, and authentication tasks.
