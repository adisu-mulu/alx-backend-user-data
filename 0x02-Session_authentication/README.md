# Session Authentication Programs

## Introduction

This directory contains programs related to session authentication, a crucial aspect of building secure web applications. Session authentication is used to identify and authorize users across multiple requests, ensuring the security of sensitive data and user interactions.

In this directory, you will find Python scripts that demonstrate various aspects of session authentication, from creating and managing user sessions to implementing secure session-based login systems.

## Program Descriptions

- [api](https://github.com/iakev/alx-backend-user-data/tree/main/0x02-Session_authentication/api): This directory contains Python scripts that serve as an API for session authentication. It includes endpoints and functionalities for managing user sessions securely.

- [models](https://github.com/iakev/alx-backend-user-data/tree/main/0x02-Session_authentication/models): The models directory contains Python scripts that define and interact with database models related to session authentication. These models are used to store user data and session information.

## Compiling and Executing

To run these Python scripts, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.

2. Navigate to the directory containing the Python script you want to run.

3. Use the python command to execute the script. Replace `script.py` with the name of the Python script you want to run:

   ```bash
   python script.py
   ```

For example, to run a script from the api directory, you would navigate to the api directory and execute the desired script using the python command.

## Requirements

Make sure to install the required dependencies listed in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/iakev/alx-backend-user-data/blob/main/0x02-Session_authentication/requirements.txt) using a package manager like pip:

```bash
https://github.com/iakev/alx-backend-user-data/blob/main/0x02-Session_authentication/requirements.txt
```

This will install the necessary packages and libraries to run the scripts successfully.
